Usage:

    NSString *songPath = @"/var/mobile/SomeSong.mp3"; // may be M4A, AAC, etc. as well
    NSDictionary *metadata = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
        @"Song Title", kIPIKeyTitle,
        @"Author or Singer", kIPIKeyArtist,
        @"Heavy metal", kIPIKeyGenre,
        [NSNumber numberWithInt:durationInSeconds * 1000], kIPIKeyDuration,
        [NSNumber numberWithInt:releaseYearOfTheSong], kIPIKeyYear,
        nil
    ];
    [[IPIPodImporter sharedInstance] importFileAtPath:songPath withMetadata:metadata];

The import occurs almost instantly, on the test device it never took longer than 3 seconds.
